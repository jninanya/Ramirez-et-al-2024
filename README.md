## Crop modeling simulation: Quantifying effect of planting dates on potential potato yield
This repository aims to document the crop modeling simulation exercise performed by Ramírez et al. (2024). The [SOLANUM](https://cipotato.org/site/inrm/home/downmod.htm) model was used to determine the potential potato yield (Yp) and "roughly" quantify the effect of planting dates on Yp for the upazila (sub-district) Phultala of Khulna District in Bangladesh. The model was calibrated using the [SOLANUM's Parameter Estimator](https://doi.org/10.1515/opag-2018-0019) and run with weather data from [NASA POWER](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nasapower/index.html). 

Please see more details in Ramírez et al. (2024) and this [R markdown](https://jninanya.github.io/Ramirez-et-al-2024/) document.
