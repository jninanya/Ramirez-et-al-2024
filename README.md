# Ramirez-et-al-2024
This notebook aims to document the simulation exercise performed by Ramírez et al. (2024). The [SOLANUM](https://cipotato.org/site/inrm/home/downmod.htm) model was used to determine the potential potato yield (Yp) and "roughly" quantify the effect of sowing dates on Yp. The model was calibrated using the [SOLANUM's Parameter Estimator](https://doi.org/10.1515/opag-2018-0019) and fed with weather data from [NASA POWER](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nasapower/index.html). Please see more details in Ramírez et al. (2024).
